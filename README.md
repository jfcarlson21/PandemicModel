# PandemicModel

With close interpersonal contacts enhancing the spread of fictional virus ATCS-21 through contact and surfaces, 
theme parks across the country are closing down. In this project, the authors model the spread of a contact based virus, 
ATCS-21 through a theme park and apply safety measures, ultimately yielding both a cost and risk analysis to help theme 
park owners decide if it is fiscally responsible to reopen their park. To do this, the authors use a model set with the 
parameters of their new virus to mimic the spread within a theme park layout. Disney Worldâ€™s Magic Kingdom, located in Orlando, Florida, 
is used as an example park with their safety measures of social distancing and cleaning of surfaces as fixed implementations. 
Additionally, a user may design the layout of a new theme park in a U.S. state of their choice and select which safety measures 
(social distancing, enhanced glove-wearing enforcement, frequent cleaning) will be applied. For either simulation type, a 
graphics interface will run and will return both a risk analysis, describing the percent chance of any person catching 
ATCS-21 in the park, and a cost analysis, determining if the profits brought in by the park will outweigh the cost of 
the new safety measures.
